# KS3 Computing Lessons


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Welcome! 👋

This site contains hands-on computing lessons designed for Key Stage 3
students (ages 11-14).

Learn about how encryption and hashing keep your data safe online
through fun, interactive activities!

## Available Lessons

### 🔐 [Encryption vs Hashing](01_encryption_vs_hashing.html)

Learn the difference between encryption (lock & unlock) and hashing
(lock only). Understand why both are important for keeping your data
safe.

**Learning objectives:** - Explain the difference between encryption and
hashing - Describe when each should be used to protect data - Give
real-world examples of both

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📖 [Book Cipher Encryption](02_book_cipher_encryption.html)

Try encryption yourself using a book cipher! Send secret messages to
your classmates that only they can decode.

**What you’ll do:** - Encrypt messages using a shared “key” (a book) -
Swap encrypted messages with partners - Decrypt messages and discover
why keys are important

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔒 [Password Hashing](03_password_hashing.html)

Discover how websites protect your passwords using one-way hashing. Use
Python to see hashing in action!

**What you’ll learn:** - Why websites never store your real password -
How hashing is a one-way process - Why tiny changes create completely
different hashes - How this protects you from hackers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔐 [Encryption](04_encryption.html)

Learn how encryption works using a Caesar cipher in Python! Discover how
keys work and why encryption is different from hashing.

**What you’ll learn:** - How to encrypt and decrypt messages using a
key - Why encryption is a two-way process (unlike hashing) - How keys
protect your messages from eavesdroppers - Real-world examples of
encryption protecting your data

## Getting Started

1.  **Start with the theory**: Read [Encryption vs
    Hashing](01_encryption_vs_hashing.html) first
2.  **Try the practicals**: Work through the hands-on activities
3.  **Discuss**: Use the discussion questions to explore the concepts
    deeper
4.  **Challenge yourself**: Try the optional stretch activities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why is this important?

Every day you use encryption and hashing without realizing it:

- 🌐 **HTTPS websites** use encryption to protect your browsing
- 🔐 **Password logins** use hashing to keep accounts secure
- 💬 **Messaging apps** use encryption for private conversations
- 💳 **Online shopping** uses encryption to protect payment details

Understanding these concepts helps you: - Stay safe online - Make better
security decisions - Understand how technology protects your privacy -
Build a foundation for cybersecurity careers
