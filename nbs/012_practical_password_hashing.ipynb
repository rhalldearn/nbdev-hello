    "## Discussion Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the investigations, discuss these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-way process**: Why is it impossible to reverse a hash back to the original password?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security**: If hackers steal a database of hashed passwords, why can't they use them to log in?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency**: Why is it important that the same password always produces the same hash?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Small changes**: What did you notice when you changed just one character in a password? Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real world**: Can you think of other situations where one-way hashing might be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Hashing is one-way** - You can't reverse it\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Consistency matters** - Same input = same output (every time)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Tiny changes = huge differences** - Changing one character completely changes the hash\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Protects your privacy** - Even website owners can't see your real password\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Security through mathematics** - Hashing uses complex math that's easy one way, impossible the other\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Stretch Activities 🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: Password strength explorer\n",
    "Hash passwords of different lengths. Does a longer password create a longer hash?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: Hash comparison\n",
    "If someone gives you a hash, can you figure out what their password was by trying common passwords? (This is called a \"brute force attack\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Encryption vs Hashing\n",
    "Compare hashing to the encryption lesson you learned earlier:\n",
    "- Which one can be reversed?\n",
    "- When would you use each one?\n",
    "- Why are both important for security?\n",
    "\n",

    "Look up \"salt\" in password hashing. Why do security experts add salt to passwords before hashing them?"
