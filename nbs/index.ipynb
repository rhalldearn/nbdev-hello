Understand why both are important for keeping your data safe.\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n- Explain the difference between encryption and hashing\n- Describe when each should be used to protect data\n- Give real-world examples of both\n\n***\n\n### 📖 [Book Cipher Encryption](https://rhalldearn.github.io/ks3-computing-lessons/02_book_cipher_encryption.html)\nTry encryption yourself using a book cipher! Send secret messages to your classmates that only they can decode.\n\n**What you'll do:**\n- Encrypt messages using a shared \"key\" (a book)\n- Swap encrypted messages with partners\n- Decrypt messages and discover why keys are important\n\n***\n\n### 🔒 [Password Hashing](https://rhalldearn.github.io/ks3-computing-lessons/03_password_hashing.html)\nDiscover how websites protect your passwords using one-way hashing. Use Python to see hashing in action!\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n- Why websites never store your real password\n- How hashing is a one-way process\n- Why tiny changes create completely different hashes\n- How this protects you from hackers\n\n***\n\n### 🔐 [Encryption](https://rhalldearn.github.io/ks3-computing-lessons/04_encryption.html)\nLearn how encryption works using a Caesar cipher in Python! Discover how keys work and why encryption is different from hashing.\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n- How to encrypt and decrypt messages using a key\n- Why encryption is a two-way process (unlike hashing)\n- How keys protect your messages from eavesdroppers\n- Real-world examples of encryption protecting your data"
