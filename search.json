They want to send secret messages to each other, but Eve (the eavesdropper) is trying to read them!\nEncryption is like putting your message in a locked box. Only someone with the right key can unlock it and read the message.\n\nHow does encryption work?\n\nEncrypt: Take your original message (called “plaintext”) and scramble it using a key\nSend: Send the scrambled message (called “ciphertext”) - even if Eve intercepts it, she can’t read it!\nDecrypt: The receiver uses the same key to unscramble the message back to plaintext\n\n\n\nWhy is this important?\nEvery day, encryption protects your data: - 🔒 HTTPS websites encrypt your browsing so hackers can’t see what you’re doing - 💬 Messaging apps encrypt your messages so only you and the recipient can read them - 💳 Online shopping encrypts your payment details so they can’t be stolen - 📧 Email can be encrypted to keep your private conversations safe\n\n\nEncryption vs Hashing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nEncryption 🔐\nHashing 🔒\n\n\n\n\nCan it be reversed?\n✅ Yes (with the key)\n❌ No (one-way only)\n\n\nWhat’s it used for?\nProtecting data in transit\nProtecting stored passwords\n\n\nDo you need a key?\n✅ Yes (to encrypt AND decrypt)\n❌ No (just hash it)\n\n\nExample\nEncrypted email message\nHashed password in database\n\n\n\nBoth are important for security, but they solve different problems!",

But did you know that good websites never store your actual password?\nInstead, they use a special mathematical process called hashing to scramble it into a unique code. This code: - Always looks like random letters and numbers - Can’t be reversed back to your password - Changes completely if even one character in your password changes\n\nWhy is this important?\nImagine a hacker breaks into a website’s database: - Bad website (stores passwords): Hacker sees “password123” and can log into your account! - Good website (stores hashes): Hacker sees “ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc08a44a4e166c06659911881f383d4473e94f” - useless to them!\n\n\nHow does login still work?\nWhen you log in, the website: 1. Takes your password 2. Hashes it the same way 3. Compares the hash to the one they stored 4. If they match - you’re in! ✅",
